Emphatic-TD (ETD), proposed by Sutton et al. in 2015, estimates the transitive dependency between states (called the \emph{followon trace}) and uses that to reweight TD updates to appear on-policy.

Estimating the followon trace is very difficult. Modern ETD algorithms do this using a form of reversed TD, which makes it vulnerable to regularization bias, as we show above.
